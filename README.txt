Volkswagen WeConnect (Europe) lets you integrate your car into Homey, giving you live insight into its status and controls. Monitor battery level, charging power, and remaining time to a full charge. You can activate or deactivate climate control and track upcoming inspections, all from within your smart home environment.

This integration helps streamline day-to-day routines. Pre-heat your car on cold mornings, automatically stop charging at a specific target level, or trigger home automations based on your carâ€™s state. It makes your Volkswagen a connected part of your home, providing both convenience and smarter energy use without requiring separate apps or manual checks.
